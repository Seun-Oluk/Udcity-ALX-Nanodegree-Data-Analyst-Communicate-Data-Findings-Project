## by (Seun Olukanmi)


## Dataset

> The data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 features on each loan, including loan amount, interest rate (or borrower rate), current loan status, borrower income, and a lot more. From observation of the data dictionary, the features can be classified into two (2) main categories namely: borrower data, and loan performance data. Necessary packages were imported and the structure of the dataset was examined after being loaded into the notebook. Specific wrangling steps that were carried out include: looking at the first five rows of the dataset, examining the variable types, and examining the basic statistics of the dataset. 


## Summary of Findings

> I explored the Prosper loan data using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis/visualizations to answer my question of interest which is: finding the relationship between the loan amount given given/taken out and several borrower features in the dataset.
> A summary of my findings is given below:
> 1. It was observed that the most frquently loaned amount is 4000. 
> 2. Most of the borrowers are employed and a majority are from California.
> 3. Apart from "other" which is the highest, the next largest category of borrowers are professionals
> 4. It can be seen from the bar chart that most of the borrowers fall in the 25000 - 49999 range closely followed by the 50000 - 74999 income range. 
> 5. The C prosper rating is the highest assigned to borrowers. 
> 6. It was also observed that most of the borrowers have a debt to income ratio of around 20% 
> 7. Most of the borrowers do not have record of delinquencies in the last 7 years. 
> 8. It was observed that the median loan amount increases as the income range of the borrowers increase. The maximum loan amount also generally increases with income range. The borrowers in the income range 100,000 and above are the only group that took loan above 25,000 
> 9. The poorer the prosper rating of the borrower, the lower the loan amount given/taken out. 
> 10. Only borrowers with verifiable income were given loan amounts above 25,000. 



## Key Insights for Presentation

> I am selecting my last three findings for the presentation. This is because they give direct answer to the question of interest which is:  finding the relationship between some borrower features and the loan amount given given/taken out. The direct questions are stated below: 
> 1. What is the relationship between the borrowers' income range and the loan amount given/taken out?
> 2. What is the relationship between the prosper rating of the borrower and the loan amount given/taken out?
> 3. What is the relationship between the loan amount given/taken out and a borrower indicating they have the required documentation to support their income?
